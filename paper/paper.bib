    abstract = { We propose two new conjugate-gradient-type methods for the
                solution of sparse unsymmetric linear systems. We present a new
                tridiagonalization process for unsymmetric matrices that is
                closely related to the Lanczos process. We use orthogonal
                factorizations of the tridiagonal matrix to derive the new
                algorithms USYMLQ and USYMQR in the same fashion as SYMMLQ and
