# Summary

[`LightKrylov`](https://github.com/nekStab/LightKrylov) is a Fortran package providing a collection of Krylov-based methods for solving linear systems, computing the leading eigenpairs (i.e., eigenvector-eigenvalue pairs corresponding to largest magnitude or largest real part eigenvalues) of a linear operator as well as its leading singular triplets (i.e., left singular vector, singular value, and right singular vector triplets corresponding to largest singular values). # add definition

What do we mean by lightweight? minimal dep? small code base? this improves the statement of need.

| Square systems   | Eigenvalue problems | Singular value decomposition           |
| :--------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------------------------: |
| $Ax = b$         | $Ax = \lambda x$    | $Av = \sigma u \quad A^H u = \sigma v$ |

In these fundamental problems, we work with: 
square systems, where $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$, $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ (unknown), and $b \in \mathbb{C}^n$ (known); 
eigenvalue problems, with $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$, non-zero eigenvector $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, and eigenvalue $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$; 
and singular value decomposition, where $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$ has singular value $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ with corresponding right and left singular vectors $v \in \mathbb{C}^n$ and $u \in \mathbb{C}^m$, where $A^H$ is the conjugate transpose of $A$.

When solving problems such as the ones shown above, direct methods tend to have a computational cost scaling as $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ (where $n$ is the leading dimension of $A$) making them impractical for very large-scale problems.
Even when $A$ is sparse, care needs to be taken when computing matrix factorizations such as LU or Cholesky since they can incur an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ storage cost in the worst case scenarios and introduce fill-in, where the factorization becomes significantly less sparse than the original matrix. % https://relate.cs.illinois.edu/course/cs450-f19/f/demos/upload/pdes/Sparse%20Matrix%20Factorizations%20and%20Fill-In.html maybe not necessary 

In contrast, Krylov methods only need a function computing the matrix-vector product $u \leftarrow Av$ (or $u \leftarrow A^H v$ in adjoint case), or even a function that yields the action of $A$ without explicitly forming the matrix at all, to iteratively construct a *Krylov subspace* [@krylov-1931], defined as $\mathcal{K}_k(A, v) = \text{span}\{v, Av, A^2v, \ldots, A^{k-1}v\}$ for an initial vector $v$. 

For sparse matrices, these methods typically require $\mathcal{O}(k \cdot \text{nnz} + k^2n)$ operations (where "nnz" is the number of non-zero elements in $A$) and $\mathcal{O}(kn)$ storage, with $k \ll n$ iterations. 
When $k$ is much smaller than $n$ and $A$ is sufficiently sparse, this approach becomes more efficient than direct methods.
The additional $k^2n$ term accounts for orthogonalization costs in methods like GMRES, while simpler methods like Conjugate Gradient have lower orthogonalization costs.

Each problem type leverages Krylov subspaces differently: linear systems via projection methods like GMRES, eigenvalue problems through Rayleigh-Ritz extraction, and singular value problems using processes like Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization. 
Convergence can often be accelerated using preconditioning techniques, which transform the original problem into a mathematically equivalent but numerically more favorable one.

# Statement of need

## A collection of Krylov-based algorithms in pure modern Fortran

`LightKrylov` aims to provide Fortran users with familiar `scipy`-inspired interfaces to a collection of widely used Krylov techniques. No other moden Fortran open-source package providing this functionality, especially aligned to modern std_lib. 

These include:

- **Krylov processes:** Arnoldi factorization, Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization, as well as Lanczos tridiagonalization for Hermitian operators.
- **Krylov methods:**
    - **Linear systems -** Conjugate Gradient (CG), Generalized Minimal Residual method (GMRES) and Flexible GMRES.
    - **Spectral decomposition -** Arnoldi iteration with Krylov-Schur restart for non-Hermitian operators, Lanczos tridiagonalization with thick restart for Hermitian ones.
    - **SVD -** restarted Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization.

A block version of the Arnoldi iterative process is also provided.
Libraries exposing more methods exist in other languages, e.g. `Krylov.jl` [@montoison-2023] in `Julia` or `PETSc` [@petsc-web-page] for instance.
Integrating large multi-language libraries like PETSc into existing Fortran codes often presents significant challenges related to build systems, dependency management, and potential performance overhead from language interfacing ('two-language problem'). Integrating these into an existing Fortran code base might however prove challenging, either because of the two languages problem or the need of special privileges for installation on a cluster and managing the dependencies.
In contrast, `LightKrylov` provides a pure Fortran alternative, fully compliant with the Fortran 2018 standard, and only requires `stdlib` as external run-time dependency.
It leverages stdlib not only for basic utilities but specifically builds upon stdlib_linalg (and ...) for foundational linear algebra operations, ensuring adherence to community standards and benefiting from its rapid ongoing developments.

Additionally, using `fypp` [@fypp-webpage] as build-time dependency, significantly reduces code duplication and maintenance effort, ensuring consistency across different data types (`single`, `double`, `extended` and `quadruple precision`) both for `real` and `complex` numbers while keeping the core algorithmic logic centralized. `fypp` is a Python-based Fortran preprocessor that automatically generates the necessary code for different data types.
Finally, its build process relies on the Fortran package manager `fpm`, greatly facilitating its installation and its incorporation into the modern Fortran ecosystem.

## A focus on abstract linear operators and abstract vectors

From a mathematical point of view, Krylov methods can be implemented without making explicit reference to the particular data structure used to represent a vector or a linear operator nor to how the actual matrix-vector product is being implemented.
To do so, `LightKrylov` uses modern Fortran `abstract` type constructs.
A stripped-down version of the abstract vector type is shown below.

```fortran
type, abstract :: abstract_vector_rdp
  ! Abstract type defining a (double precision) vector which can be extended
  ! by users to accomodate their particular data structure and associated
  ! computational routines.
  contains
    ! Abstract procedure to compute the scalar-vector product.
    procedure(abstract_scal_rdp) , pass(self), deferred :: scal
    ! Abstract procedure to compute y = alpha*x + beta*y
    procedure(abstract_axpby_rdp), pass(self), deferred:: axpby
    ! Abstract procedure to compute the vector dot product.
    procedure(abstract_dot_rdp)  , pass(self), deferred :: dot
end type
```

The three abstract type-bound procedures correspond to the basic set of operations on vectors, namely scalar-vector product, linear combination of two vectors, and the dot product. These operations correspond to the essential building blocks required by Krylov algorithms.
The signatures of these type-bound procedures follow, to the extent possible, the standard signatures of the corresponding `blas` functions for a more familiar use.
For instance, the `abstract_axpby_rdp` interface is defined as

```fortran
abstract interface
  subroutine abstract_axpby_rdp(alpha, vec, beta, self)
    double precision          , intent(in)    :: alpha, beta
    class(abstract_vector_rdp), intent(in)    :: vec
    class(abstract_vector_rdp), intent(inout) :: self
  end subroutine
end interface
```
mimicking the signature of the (extended) BLAS-2 subroutine `axpby`.
Note that, in practice, `LightKrylov` requires the definition of two additional procedures, one to set a vector to zero and the second to fill it with random data.

Similarly, a stripped-down version of an abstract linear operator type is shown below.

```fortran
type, abstract: abstract_linop_rdp
  ! Abstract type defining a (real, double precision) linear operator which
  ! can be extended by users to accomodate their particular data structure
  ! and associated kernels for the matrix-vector product.
  contains
    ! Abstract procedure to compute the matrix-vector product y = A * x
    procedure(abstract_matvec_rdp), pass(self), deferred :: matvec
    ! Abstract procedure to compute the matrix-vector product y = A^H * x
    procedure(abstract_matvec_rdp), pass(self), deferred :: rmatvec
end type
```

The two type-bound procedures need to implement the matrix-vector product and the transposed matrix-vector product, respectively.
The corresponding abstract interface reads

```fortran
abstract interface
  subroutine abstract_matvec_rdp(self, vec_in, vec_out)
    class(abstract_linop_rdp) , intent(inout) :: self
    class(abstract_vector_rdp), intent(in)    :: vec_in
    class(abstract_vector_rdp), intent(out)   :: vec_out
  end subroutine
end interface
```
Using such `abstract` types enables us to focus on the high-level implementation of the different Krylov-based algorithms while leaving the performance-critical details of the different vector and matrix-vector operations to the users.

# Preconditioners

The abstract operator definition readily accommodates preconditioning. Users can implement the matvec routine to apply$M**{â1}A$ or define a separate preconditioner application operator if required by the specific Krylov variant (like Flexible GMRES, which is included).

# General example
1. User-defined a vector type extending abstract_vector_rdp.
2. User-defined a linear operator type extending abstract_linop_rdp (e.g., one using sparse matrix format AND a matrix-free).
3. Instantiate and call a LightKrylov solver (e.g., gmres or arnoldi) using these objects.

# Advanced example in a production-ready open-source code
Explicitly show or maybe just mention it and referer to the repo links to keep the paper concise. (idea)
For instance, LightKrylov was successfully integrated into neklab [@citation_if_available], a toolbox for stability and bifurcation analysis using the high-performance spectral element solver `Nek5000` [@nek5000_citation]. The abstract vector interface allowed direct use of Nek5000's distributed data structures, and the pure-Fortran nature facilitated integration with its existing build system, demonstrating the library's suitability for large-scale HPC applications.

# Performance considerations
  Compare with `Krylov.jl` in `Julia`, NekStab or KthFramework (ARPACK) to show we added no overhead - performance is equal or better.

# Licensing

LightKrylov is distributed under the permissive XXX license, encouraging broad adoption and contribution.

# Testing/CI

The library includes a suite of unit and integration tests, automatically executed via Continuous Integration [ADD badge], ensuring correctness and robustness.

# Limitations/Future Work

Currently, LightKrylov focuses on serial execution, relying on the user's implementation for parallelism within vector/operator routines. Future directions may include exploring hybrid parallelism interfaces or expanding the collection of algorithms / perhaps GPU support? Contributions are welcome via the project's GitHub repository
