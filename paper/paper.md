# Summary

[`LightKrylov`](https://github.com/nekStab/LightKrylov) is a modern Fortran package implementing a collection of Krylov subspace methods for solving a variety of linear problems:

| Square systems   | Eigenvalue problems | Singular value decomposition           |
| :--------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------------------------: |
| $Ax = b$         | $Ax = \lambda x$    | $Av = \sigma u \quad A^H u = \sigma v$ |

Here, $A^H$ denotes the conjugate transpose of $A$, coinciding with the standard transpose if $A$ is real-valued.
Direct methods often require explicit storage of $A$.
Even if $A$ is sparse, computing its QR or Cholesky factorization to invert a linear system might lead to prohibitve storage requirements or computational costs.
In contrast, Krylov methods only need a function computing the matrix-vector product $u \leftarrow Av$ (and possibly $u \leftarrow A^H v$) to iteratively construct the *Krylov subspace* [@krylov-1931].
Over the past decades, Krylov methods have become a critical element of high-performance computing.
We refer interested readers to @ipsen-1998 for an introduction to Krylov methods, to @saad-2003 for technical details and to @frantz-2023 for examples of their usage in the field of computational fluid dynamics.

# Statement of need

## A collection of Krylov-based algorithms

To the extend possible, `LightKrylov` tries to provide Fortran users with a friendly interface inspired from `scipy` [@?] to a collection of widely used Krylov techniques, including

- **Krylov processes:** Arnoldi, Rational Arnoldi and Two-sided Arnoldi factorizations, Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization as well as Hermitian and Non-Hermitian Lanczos tridiagonalization.
- **Krylov methods:** Conjugate Gradient (CG), Conjugate Gradient for the Normal equation (CGNE), Minimal residual method (MINRES), Generalized minimal residual method (GMRES), Flexible GMRES, (Two-sided) Arnoldi with Krylov-Schur restart for general eigenproblems, Lanczos with thick restart for Hermitian eigenproblems, restarted Golub-Kahan method for singular value decomposition.
- **Krylov-based preconditioners:** Polynomial Arnoldi preconditioner.

Although there exist libraries exposing more methods in other languages, see for instance `Krylov.jl` [@montoison-2023] in `Julia`, it needs to be emphasized that `LightKrylov` is written in pure Fortran and relies on a minimalistic set of dependencies which can all be taken care of using the Fortran package manager `fpm` [@?].
Hence, it makes it a suitable choice for integration into existing code bases widely used in numerous areas of high-performance scientific computing.
As an example, `LightKrylov` has recently been integrated into `neklab`, an open-source toolbox for stability and bifurcation analysis built around the massively parallel spectral element solver `Nek5000`.
