# Summary

[`LightKrylov`](https://github.com/nekStab/LightKrylov) is a modern Fortran package implementing a collection of Krylov subspace methods for solving a variety of linear problems:

| Square systems   | Eigenvalue problems | Singular value decomposition           |
| :--------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------------------------: |
| $Ax = b$         | $Ax = \lambda x$    | $Av = \sigma u \quad A^H u = \sigma v$ |

Here, $A^H$ denotes the conjugate transpose of $A$, coinciding with the standard transpose if $A$ is real-valued.
Direct methods often require explicit storage of $A$.
Even if $A$ is sparse, computing its QR or Cholesky factorization to invert a linear system might lead to prohibitve storage requirements or computational costs.
In contrast, Krylov methods only need a function computing the matrix-vector product $u \leftarrow Av$ (and possibly $u \leftarrow A^H v$) to iteratively construct the *Krylov subspace* [@krylov-1931].
Over the past decades, Krylov methods have become a critical element of high-performance computing.
We refer interested readers to [@ipsen-1998] for an introduction to Krylov methods, to [@saad-2003] for technical details and to [@frantz-2023] for examples of their usage in the field of computational fluid dynamics.

# Statement of need

## A collection of Krylov-based algorithms
