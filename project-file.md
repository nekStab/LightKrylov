## Scope

The goal of `LightKrylov` is to provide a lightweight implementation of many standard Krylov techniques using modern `Fortran` features, including: 

- Linear solvers for \( \mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b} \)
      + [`cg`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method) when \( \mathbf{A} \) is a symmetric (hermitian) positive definite matrix.
      + [`gmres`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_minimal_residual_method) when \( \mathbf{A} \) is a non-symmetric square linear operator.
- Krylov-based matrix factorizations
      + `arnoldi` - Construct an upper Hessenberg matrix \( \mathbf{H} \) and an orthonormal (unitary) basis \( \mathbf{X} \) capturing the dominant eigenspace of a square non-symmetric matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) using the [`Arnoldi`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnoldi_iteration) iterative process.
      + `lanczos` - Construct a symmetric (hermitian) tridiagonal matrix \( \mathbf{T} \) and an orthonormal (unitary) basis \( \mathbf{X} \) capturing the dominant eigenspace of a symmetric (hermitian) linear operator \( \mathbf{A} \) using the [`Lanczos`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm) iterative process.
      + `bidiagonalization` - Construct a bidiagonal matrix \( \mathbf{B} \) and orthonormal bases \( \mathbf{U} \) and \( \mathbf{V} \) for the dominant column (resp. row) span of a general linear operator \( \mathbf{A} \) using the  [`Lanczos bidiagonalization`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidiagonalization) iterative process.
- Eigenvalue solvers for \( \mathbf{Ax} = \lambda \mathbf{x} \)
      + `eigs` to compute the largest eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of a general square linear operator \( \mathbf{A} \) using the [`Arnoldi`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnoldi_iteration) iterative process.
      + `eighs` to compute the largest eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of a symmetric (hermitian) linear operator \( \mathbf{A} \) using the [`Lanczos`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm) iterative process.
- Singular value decomposition \( \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^H \)
      + `svds` to compute the leading singular triplets of a general linear operator \( \mathbf{A} \) using the [`Lanczos bidiagonalization`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidiagonalization) iterative process.
- Solving a system of nonlinear equations \( F(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} \)
      + `newton` to find the solution to \( F(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} \) using a Newton-Krylov solver with optimal step size found by a simple bisection method.

While similar and more feature-complete packages exist (e.g. [Arpack](https://www.arpack.org), [SLEPC](https://slepc.upv.es/) or [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io/)), the use of `abstract_type` in `LightKrylov` and its nearly non-existant list of dependencies makes it far easier to incorporate into an existing code base. Preliminary benchmark results moreover show that it is on par with `Arpack` in terms of accuracy and computational performances.
